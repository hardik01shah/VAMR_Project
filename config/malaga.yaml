    method: 'trf' 
    # Method to use in the optimization. Should be one of
      # 'trf' : Trust Region Reflective algorithm, particularly suitable for large sparse problems with bounds. Generally robust method.
      # 'dogbox' : dogleg algorithm with rectangular trust regions, typical use case is small problems with bounds. Not recommended for problems with rank-deficient Jacobian.
      # 'lm' : Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in MINPACK. Doesn't handle bounds and sparse Jacobians. Usually the most efficient method for small unconstrained problems.
